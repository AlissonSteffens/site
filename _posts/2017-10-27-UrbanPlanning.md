*This project is about how to rebuilding the university to optimize the process of decision-making with technology and studies instead of only opinions and feelings. We have developed guidelines for creating new living spaces and green areas in the Campus. The main focus about this work is discovering how to integrate people and buildings to turn the university into a friendly, human and also technological place.*
