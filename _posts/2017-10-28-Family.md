*That is a theme about how to engage families to participate of school’s life using technology as a tool but not the main point. Here the families and children were invited to create, share and get to know more about other school families.*

## Projects

### **(2017 - now) Scratch Jr. Day:** 

First Edition of Scratch Jr: a Family Day in Brazilian communities to bring relatives and children (5 years old) to enjoy a different day using Scratch. After that, I reviewed the protocol and made adaptations to make it more effective in Brazilian reality (turning it in a Scratch Day).
