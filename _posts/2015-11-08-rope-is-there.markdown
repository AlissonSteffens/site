Abstract	Motivation to learn and how it’s methodology was developed  are important aspects for an educator to conduct their classes efficiently. Computer science studies  are designed in education in order to facilitate improvements in the learning process, through different approaches. One of these approaches, computational thinking, consists of practical learning which allows students to conduct experience and to practice concepts learned in the classroom. This concept is being discussed on many research fronts, and seeks to provide technology as a catalysing  tool for finding solutions and improve students skills,such as developing an individual belonging to the society. Practical learning and computational thinking converge, for a teaching that prioritizes creativity, inventiveness, and productivity in the students, who are the protagonists in the process of developing their own knowledge. This context led this research to identify the existence or not of patterns in the actions of a group of high school students when received the  task of setting up a programmable toy. To achieve this goal, the characteristics of a programmable toy were specified through a literature review and a guide to setting up the toy. Experiments were conducted with six students over a period of five hours. The procedures were specified through an evaluation plan, which attempted to explain the students actions by analyzing footage and portions of recorded audios. The data collected were analyzed and have shown that different groups of students use different strategies to achieve a common goal. The methodology proved herself efficient  for describing the students actions and behaviors, but haven't shown any patterns between the actions of the groups analyzed.
