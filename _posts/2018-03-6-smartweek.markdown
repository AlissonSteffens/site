Yesterday (05-03-2018), I had the chance to teach scratch for twenty-one students from Balneario Camboriú's publics school.

They had the opportunity to learn programming from games on code.org and Scratch, with LITE teachers, at Univali in Balneário Camboriú. The action is part of the 1st BC Smart Week and will be provided to other institutions on Wednesday (07).

I was working with André Raabe, Júlia Peron Metzger and Rafael Ferreira and we taught  block programming through code.org and helped the children to start programming their own game through Scratch .
