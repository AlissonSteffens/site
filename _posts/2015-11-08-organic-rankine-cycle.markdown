The water is one of the most abundant natural resources in the Earth, presenting a total reservoir of 1.4 billions of km³. However, only 2.5% of this is proper for the human consumption. Due to the population growth together with the industry evolution, the consumption of water has increased exponentially, resulting in several researches in the area of water desalination worldwide. Although  it is a promising alternative, it is estimated that 99% of the existing desalination fields use fossil fuels, contributing to the increase of the world’s pollution. Moreover, the continuous raise of the fossil fuels costs and the difficulties access to the electrical grid in some places has opened space for the use of the Renewable Energies. Because of that, the solar energy has appeared as a sustainable alternative to supply desalination fields around the world, specially in places with high solar radiation. This research shows the study of a Reverse Osmosis desalination system with an Organic Rankine Cycle powered by solar energy. Initially, was made a systematic review of the literature to gather the necessary fundamentals to the study of the process. From that, a mathematical model was developed using Brazil's climate data, obtained by using the softwares Scilab and ROSA9. After all, the implantation of the system was simulated in three coastal states of the Brazil. Among the main achievements, there was obtained the  total cost of 0.926 to 0.99$/m³ for Rio Grande do Sul, 0.936 to 0.964$/m³ for São Paulo and 0.937 to 0.956$/m³ for Rio Grande do  Norte, considering a system for a permeate flow rate of 145.8m³/h, during 9h of daily operation.
