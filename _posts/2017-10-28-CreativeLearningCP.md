*This subject is about how to invite people for having the first experience in creating any project with their own hands. Also, we discuss here about strategies to introduce maker culture on different places of the city*

## Projects

### **(2017 - now) Bifocal Modeling:** 

It is a project developed in partnership with Stanford to create modeling strategies to introduce analytical ability in high school and newers in engineering. Here we have created a protocol to help other teachers in Brazil to create their models with their students and how to analyze the results of experiences combining physical models and digital models.

**Team:** André L. M. Santana (Researcher and content creator), André Raabe (Coordinator), Tamar Furhmann (Co-Coordinator), Rodrigo R. Martins, Paulo E. Martins

### **(2015 - now) Lite is Cool:** 

The project aims to teach concepts about robotics and programming for students from local public schools.

### **(2017 - now) Lab Maker:** 

The project aims to involve students from the middle and high school with the maker culture. This year more than 100 students had participated in classes of 90 minutes per week for 9 months.

> Aging is a natural process of life and today the number of older people in the world is increasing. Brazil has faced this reality, with low birth rates and mortality rates. These events have a significant social impact, reinforcing the need for inclusion and development of projects with the elderly. The present work aims to adapt and evaluate a methodology that treats the empowerment of the elderly in the aspect of inventiveness and innovation. It is intended to formalize a product, which is a project insertion curriculum in how to use Lite Maker. Lite Maker is a mobile platform, composed of four different workstations, consisting in construction, decoration, 3D prototyping and electronics, created by the Laboratory of technological innovation in education (LITE), to develop creative activities in personal projects. The application of this experiment occurred in the SESC of Itajaí / SC, on four Mondays, during two hours per day. Eight elderly women, aged between sixty and eighty-two, participated in the project. Besides the academic, the team of collaborators was composed of five participants, all students of Univali, of the courses of Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Architecture and Urbanism. The first day was used for the elderly to have their first contact with the project, with the team of collaborators, Lite Maker and its components. The application of the initial questionnaire was carried out, trying to understand the previous experiences of each participant. Still on the first day the elderly women made artificial flowers, using the materials present in the benches. There were some complaints, reporting being a boring activity, which helped in reformulating the activities planned for the other days. In view of the enthusiasm and curiosity that the participants demonstrated regarding the 3D electronic prototyping, the second day was dedicated in going deep in these resources, providing a great interaction of the elderly with these benches. In the third meeting, the elderly started their personal projects, in which there was no interference of the staff in defining what would be done or what materials would be used. The completion of the projects occurred on the fourth day of activities. The closing of the project was a conversation, seeking to understand the satisfaction of the elderly about the project, as well as an analysis of the impact of the use of the methodology and the benefits to the target audience. The results of the activities demonstrate that projects of personal interest contribute to the satisfaction of the elderly and in this application the satisfaction was enhanced by the use of technologies, programming tools and digital prototyping.

> DIY or Do-It-Yourself is what sets the philosophy of the maker movement, in which the user makes the entire development, creation and assembly of any product. With the growth of the maker movement around the world, which has been gaining ground in Brazil, raised the number of collaborative environments defined as makerspaces. Community spaces are equipped with multiple machines and equipments for rapid prototyping, usually controlled by numerical control (CNC). Among the machines of rapid prototyping found in makerspaces, the laser cutting machines are the most popular for its low degree of complexity and prototyping speed, the downside is given only by the high-added cost on these machines, making it impossible to use in small makerspaces. The present work dealt with the construction of a laser cutter and tests of validation cutting of a set of specific materials. The samples for validity tests, are from materials found in laboratories, such as paper and E.V.A. The results obtained in the tests were very satisfying, since the machine implemented in the project generating similar results and / or superior to the industrial machine. The results were validated by means of a test-t with independent samples and normalized by means of two-tailed validation. This test was done cutting-off averages of 30 samples for each of the three materials used. In all cases, H1 hypothesis was rejected, defining in this case, the samples resemble each other. Only materials such as acrylic, MDF and other types of wood, did not allow the machine cut of this project. It is believed that the factor that has limited this procedure is related to a laser power and the fact that some materials are translucent. The cost of manufacturing the machine was R$ 1,678.61, what is approximately 10% of the cost of the industrial machine found in the market and presenting cuts of equivalent quality.

>Most used teaching method in Introductory Programing is the proposition of problems, in which is presented the enunciation with a described problem and, from it is elaborated an algorithm to solve it. There are several difficulties presented, mainly related to the comprehension and interpretation of the enunciation. Analyzing the enunciations presented in textbooks used in Brazil, it was observed that, generally, they are objectives, without evidences of the process of solving and without exemplification, in a purely Mathematics context. In this scenery, it was formulated the research question: the structure and/or context of an enunciation have influence upon the performance of Introductory Programming students in the problem solving? For answer it, research on relevance theory and learning theory and a significant an experiment was carried out in order to test the enunciations, considering context and structure; in the context we used the math, the traditional and the games, the motivator; and for structure was used the non-structured shape, traditional, and structured with complete data. In this experiment, eight classes of students have participated and they are from six Brazilian Higher Education Institution. The students were distributed in four groups, considering the profile and each group solve a type of evaluation and answer a questionnaire. Three analyses were carried out. On the first one, a test of hypothesis was performed, relating the context and the structure with the performance of students, using the logistic regression technique. It was observed statistical difference related to the structure, mainly when the context is math. It was also presented differences related to the student base-performance. On the second analysis was verified the solutions presented and on the third the answers of final questionnaire were analyzed. The worst result was presented by the group which performed the evaluation in non-structured math context, which is the model traditionally used. The best result was on structured math, what lead us to conclude that invest efforts worth in the elaboration of enunciation.
