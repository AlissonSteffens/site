*This subject is about how to invite people for having the first experience in creating any project with their own hands. Also, we discuss here about strategies to introduce maker culture on different places of the city*

> Aging is a natural process of life and today the number of older people in the world is increasing. Brazil has faced this reality, with low birth rates and mortality rates. These events have a significant social impact, reinforcing the need for inclusion and development of projects with the elderly. The present work aims to adapt and evaluate a methodology that treats the empowerment of the elderly in the aspect of inventiveness and innovation. It is intended to formalize a product, which is a project insertion curriculum in how to use Lite Maker. Lite Maker is a mobile platform, composed of four different workstations, consisting in construction, decoration, 3D prototyping and electronics, created by the Laboratory of technological innovation in education (LITE), to develop creative activities in personal projects. The application of this experiment occurred in the SESC of Itajaí / SC, on four Mondays, during two hours per day. Eight elderly women, aged between sixty and eighty-two, participated in the project. Besides the academic, the team of collaborators was composed of five participants, all students of Univali, of the courses of Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Architecture and Urbanism. The first day was used for the elderly to have their first contact with the project, with the team of collaborators, Lite Maker and its components. The application of the initial questionnaire was carried out, trying to understand the previous experiences of each participant. Still on the first day the elderly women made artificial flowers, using the materials present in the benches. There were some complaints, reporting being a boring activity, which helped in reformulating the activities planned for the other days. In view of the enthusiasm and curiosity that the participants demonstrated regarding the 3D electronic prototyping, the second day was dedicated in going deep in these resources, providing a great interaction of the elderly with these benches. In the third meeting, the elderly started their personal projects, in which there was no interference of the staff in defining what would be done or what materials would be used. The completion of the projects occurred on the fourth day of activities. The closing of the project was a conversation, seeking to understand the satisfaction of the elderly about the project, as well as an analysis of the impact of the use of the methodology and the benefits to the target audience. The results of the activities demonstrate that projects of personal interest contribute to the satisfaction of the elderly and in this application the satisfaction was enhanced by the use of technologies, programming tools and digital prototyping.
