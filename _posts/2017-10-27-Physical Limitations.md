*This researches are about the creation of producuts to help people with physical limittat. Here we discuss how to create low-cost technology to replace conventional computer interfaces and hand prosthesis for people with arm and hands amputation.*

## Projects

### **(2017 - now) Brain Computer Interface:** 

That is a theme about fluid interfaces and try to help people with physical limitations to interact with computational devices. For example, how people with Cerebral palsy could play with Programmable Toys? Maybe Brain-Computer Interface could help on it.

**Team:** André L. M. Santana (Coordinator), Yan Alexander Venera (Computer Science)

### **(Under Development) Low-Cost Prosthetic Hand:** 

A prosthetic hand was developed to decrease the cost and increase the quality of a cheap prosthesis. The prosthesis was designed to be built with Polylactic acid and costs less than $500..

**Team:** André L. M. Santana (Coordinator) and Valdeci Sartori Junior (Mechanical Engineering)

The humankind have been developing technology since the beginning of their existence. Researches reports that humans search to create tools and improve techniques for greater comfort and quality of life. The evolution of technology has come to the point of allowing the recording of human brain waves with a hardware non-invasively, generating an electroencephalogram for future analysis. Through the capture of brain waves this paper has implemented a structure that receives inputs from the human brain, working with these inputs through computational techniques of artificial intelligence to apply in evaluation process for digital interaction. The research wanted to confirm the hypothesis that the structure is able to classify the inputs and control a human computer interface. Two groups of people in different situations used the hardware to execute existent binary commands for interacting with an application that received binary parameters. This application aims to create a communication interface, like this, when the person thinks in “Select”, electrical impulses of the brain will be inputs for the structure developed, that will classify the input and generate the command “Select” in the application. Statistical validations were used to validate accuracy of the structure. Performing the tests of the structure developed in the two groups, the first group in good environment conditions and the second group in bad environment conditions, it was possible to insure that the structure had a high accuracy when people have good conditions for the test, obtaining 100% accuracy in some cases and other cases have reached 90% to 70% accuracy, results similar to area of occupation of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. In the second group, it was believed that bad conditions affected people in the test, the best accuracy was 60%, same percentage reached in the occupation area of the ROC curve. Therefore, this paper intends to assist in many areas of study, implementing a structure and an analysis of main results obtained during the process.
