# Education

That subjects were meant to find ways to introduce Creative Learning in public schools. Additionally, we have started to develop curriculums, toys, social networks and protocols to help other universities and spaces to try the same thing in Brazil. Finally, we have started to create low-cost tools such as a laser-cutter to help in the dissemination of maker culture in Brazil.

Portugol Studio is a tool for learning programming, aimed at people who speak Portuguese. It has an easy syntax based on C and PHP, several examples and materials to support learning. It also makes it possible to create games and other applications.

## Creative Learning

Aging is a natural process of life and today the number of older people in the world is increasing. Brazil has faced this reality, with low birth rates and mortality rates. These events have a significant social impact, reinforcing the need for inclusion and development of projects with the elderly. The present work aims to adapt and evaluate a methodology that treats the empowerment of the elderly in the aspect of inventiveness and innovation. It is intended to formalize a product, which is a project insertion curriculum in how to use Lite Maker. Lite Maker is a mobile platform, composed of four different workstations, consisting in construction, decoration, 3D prototyping and electronics, created by the Laboratory of technological innovation in education (LITE), to develop creative activities in personal projects. The application of this experiment occurred in the SESC of Itajaí / SC, on four Mondays, during two hours per day. Eight elderly women, aged between sixty and eighty-two, participated in the project. Besides the academic, the team of collaborators was composed of five participants, all students of Univali, of the courses of Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Architecture and Urbanism. The first day was used for the elderly to have their first contact with the project, with the team of collaborators, Lite Maker and its components. The application of the initial questionnaire was carried out, trying to understand the previous experiences of each participant. Still on the first day the elderly women made artificial flowers, using the materials present in the benches. There were some complaints, reporting being a boring activity, which helped in reformulating the activities planned for the other days. In view of the enthusiasm and curiosity that the participants demonstrated regarding the 3D electronic prototyping, the second day was dedicated in going deep in these resources, providing a great interaction of the elderly with these benches. In the third meeting, the elderly started their personal projects, in which there was no interference of the staff in defining what would be done or what materials would be used. The completion of the projects occurred on the fourth day of activities. The closing of the project was a conversation, seeking to understand the satisfaction of the elderly about the project, as well as an analysis of the impact of the use of the methodology and the benefits to the target audience. The results of the activities demonstrate that projects of personal interest contribute to the satisfaction of the elderly and in this application the satisfaction was enhanced by the use of technologies, programming tools and digital prototyping.

 Tem Ideia na Rede is a project introduce Computer Science and Technology in all Itajai’s (my hometown) public schools through Creative Learning.The project achieved about 28 schools of the municipal education network in 2016 with the keypoint of allowing public school students to develop their own projects related to Computer Science and even interact with each other in a platform created specifically for science knowledge sharing. And this year, with the new Tem Ideia na Rede - 2017 edition - the students have submitted a lot of great experiences. They were sharing their projects like in a social network, with small missions divided into seven categories: for fun, sound, tutorial, hands-on, plan, design, and programming. That results were really amazing! Students left their communities, involving their family, their neighborhood, teachers and school.

First Edition of Scratch Jr: a Family Day in Brazilian communities to bring relatives and children (5 years old) to enjoy a different day using Scratch. After that, I reviewed the protocol and made adaptations to make it more effective in Brazilian reality (turning it in a Scratch Day).
